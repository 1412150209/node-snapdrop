Just the original [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/Snapdrop), with complete Node.js server.

> **Warning**\
> Due to [Heroku Free Plan Shutdown](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/issues/15), node-snapdrop server has changed and can now be reached [here](https://node-snapdrop.onrender.com).\
> Old server will be kept (without any code update) until November 28, 2022, then it will be shutdown by Heroku.
